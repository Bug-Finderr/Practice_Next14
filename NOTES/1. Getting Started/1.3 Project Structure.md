# Understanding the Next.js Project Structure

## 1. Root Files Overview

At the root level of the project, we have several files:

- **`package.json`**: Contains project dependencies and scripts.

  - Essential dependencies: `next`, `react`, and `react-dom`.
  - Optional dependencies based on your setup: `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `eslint`.
  - Key scripts:
    - `dev`: Starts the app in development mode.
    - `build`: Builds the app for production.
    - `start`: Starts the production server.
    - `lint`: Runs ESLint.

- **Configuration Files**:

  - `next.config.js`: Configuration for Next.js.
  - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript settings.
  - `eslint.json`: ESLint configuration.
  - `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`: Tailwind CSS settings.

- **Other files**:
  - `package-lock.json`: Ensures consistent dependency installation.
  - `.gitignore`: Specifies files to ignore in version control.
  - `README.md`: Instructions for the project.
  - `next-env.d.ts`: TypeScript declarations for Next.js.

## 2. Folder Structure

- **`.next` Folder**: Generated when you run the `dev` or `build` scripts. It serves the Next.js application and is ignored by Git.

- **`node_modules` Folder**: Contains all the installed project dependencies.

- **`public` Folder**: Stores static assets such as images, icons, and SVGs.

- **`src` Folder**: This is the most important folder, where most of the development takes place. Inside it, we have the `app` folder.

## 3. The `app` Folder (New App Router)

The `app` folder is central to Next.js development using the new App Router. Inside it, you’ll find:

- **`favicon.ico`**: The browser tab icon.
- **`global.css`**: Global styles for your app.
- **`layout.tsx`**: Defines the root layout and UI shared across pages.
- **`page.tsx`**: The main page component (renders the home component at `localhost:3000`).

When you run the command `npm run dev`, the flow is as follows:

- **Layout rendering**: The root layout component in `layout.tsx` is rendered.
- **Page rendering**: The component in `page.tsx` is rendered as the `children` prop inside `layout.tsx`, forming the complete UI displayed in the browser.

## 4. Control Flow

Here’s the basic control flow when you run the app:

1. **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server.
2. **`layout.tsx`**: The root layout component is rendered.
3. **`page.tsx`**: The component defined here is displayed as the main content when navigating to `localhost:3000`.
