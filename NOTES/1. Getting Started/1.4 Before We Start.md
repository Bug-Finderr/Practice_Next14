# Intro to React Server Components (RSC)

Before diving into routing in Next.js, it's important to understand [**React Server Components (RSC)**](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components)—a new architecture introduced in React 18. RSC changes the way we build components by splitting them into two types:

## Key Points

1. **Server Components:**

   - By default, all components in Next.js are server components.
   - They can perform server-side tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.
   - However, they **cannot** handle user interactions or use React hooks.

2. **Client Components:**
   - To create a client component, add `"use client"` at the top of the file.
   - Client components can handle user interactions and utilize hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
   - Unlike server components, they **cannot** perform server-side tasks such as file I/O or database queries.

Server components help optimize performance by handling heavy tasks on the server, while client components allow for interactive, dynamic UI.

## Why RSC Matters for Routing

When we explore routing, we'll see examples of:

- **Server Components** waiting for data to load (like fetching from a database) before rendering.
- **Client Components** using hooks from the routing module to manage interactivity.

Having a basic understanding of RSC will help you grasp the routing system more effectively. Don't worry if it feels a bit abstract—things will become clearer as we dive deeper into the series.
