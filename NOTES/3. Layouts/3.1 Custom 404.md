# Custom 404 Pages in Next.js with the App Router

In this post, we'll explore how to define a **custom 404 page** in Next.js using the new **App Router**. By default, when you navigate to a route that is not defined in your application, Next.js displays a default **404 page**. While the default page is useful for quick prototyping, customizing the 404 page to match your application's branding and style is often desirable.

## Step 1: Creating a Custom 404 Page

To create a custom 404 page, follow these steps:

1. Inside the `app` folder, create a new file named `not-found.tsx` (or `not-found.js` if you're using JavaScript).
2. In this file, define and export a React component that will serve as your custom 404 page. For example:

   ```tsx
   export default function NotFound() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Page Not Found</h2>
         <p>Could not find the requested resource.</p>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Once the file is created, Next.js will automatically use this custom 404 page for any undefined routes.

### Step 2: Testing the Custom 404 Page

If you now navigate to a non-existent route like `localhost:3000/billing`, you should see your custom **Page Not Found** message instead of the default Next.js 404 page.

### Step 3: Programmatically Rendering the 404 Page

In some cases, you might want to display the 404 page based on certain conditions within your code. Next.js provides a `notFound` function that can be invoked to programmatically render the custom 404 page.

For example, let's assume the number of reviews for a product cannot exceed 100. If a user navigates to a review with an ID greater than 100, we can trigger the 404 page.

1. In your `page.tsx` file within the `[reviewID]` folder, import the `notFound` function from `next/navigation`:

   ```tsx
   import { notFound } from "next/navigation";
   ```

2. Inside your component, add a condition to invoke the `notFound` function if the review ID is greater than 100:

   ```tsx
   export default function ReviewDetail({
     params,
   }: {
     params: { reviewID: string };
   }) {
     if (parseInt(params.reviewID) > 100) {
       notFound();
     }

     return <h1>Review {params.reviewID}</h1>;
   }
   ```

This will trigger the custom 404 page when a review ID exceeds 100.

### Step 4: Defining NotFound Pages at Folder Level

Next.js also allows you to define custom **404 pages** at the folder level. For example, if you want a specific **"Review Not Found"** page for reviews that don't exist, create a `not-found.tsx` file within the `[reviewID]` folder.

1. Inside the `[reviewID]` folder, create a `not-found.tsx` file with the following content:

   ```tsx
   export default function NotFound() {
     return <h1>Review Not Found</h1>;
   }
   ```

2. Now, if you navigate to `localhost:3000/products/100/reviews/5`, you'll see the review details. But if you navigate to `localhost:3000/products/100/reviews/1001`, the **"Review Not Found"** page will be displayed.

### Step 5: Optional Catch-All 404 Pages

Next.js also supports optional catch-all routes for `not-found` pages. For example, if you navigate to `/docs` and want to show a custom 404 instead of the default Next.js behavior, wrap the `not-found` file with additional square brackets like so: `[[...slug]]`.

### Summary

- **Custom 404 Pages**: Create a `not-found.tsx` file in the `app` folder to customize the default 404 page.
- **Programmatically Rendering 404**: Use the `notFound` function from `next/navigation` to display the 404 page based on specific conditions.
- **Folder-Level 404 Pages**: Define `not-found.tsx` within subfolders to create folder-specific 404 pages.
- **Optional 404 Pages**: Use optional catch-all routes to handle undefined routes dynamically.
