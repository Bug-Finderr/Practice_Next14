# Layouts in Next.js

A **layout** is a shared UI component that is consistent across multiple pages in your application, such as a header and a footer. With layouts, you can define reusable structures for different parts of your app.

## What is a Layout?

A **layout** in Next.js is a React component that is exported from a `layout.tsx` (or `layout.js`) file. The layout component accepts a `children` prop, which represents the content of the page being rendered within the layout.

Layouts make it easy to define shared UI elements that appear on multiple pages, such as a header, footer, or navigation bar.

## Step 1: The Root Layout

Every Next.js application requires a **root layout**. The root layout file is found in the `app` folder and is named `layout.tsx`. This layout file is mandatory and is automatically generated by Next.js if it is missing.

### Example: Root Layout

The `layout.tsx` file might look something like this:

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `children` prop will be replaced by the page content (e.g., the content from `page.tsx` files in different folders).

### Step 2: Adding a Header and Footer

Let’s add a **header** and **footer** to the root layout. These elements will be displayed on every page in the application.

1. Open the `layout.tsx` file.
2. Modify the file to include a header and footer:

   ```tsx
   export default function RootLayout({
     children,
   }: {
     children: React.ReactNode;
   }) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>
           <header style={{ padding: "10px", backgroundColor: "#eee" }}>
             <p>Header</p>
           </header>
           {children}
           <footer style={{ padding: "10px", backgroundColor: "#eee" }}>
             <p>Footer</p>
           </footer>
         </body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Now, when you navigate to any page (e.g., `localhost:3000` or `localhost:3000/about`), the header and footer will be visible, while the page content will be injected in place of the `children` prop.

### Step 3: Layouts in Action

The layout ensures that elements like headers and footers remain consistent across all routes. For example:

- On `localhost:3000`, the **header**, **footer**, and page content from `app/page.tsx` are displayed.
- On `localhost:3000/about`, the **header**, **footer**, and page content from `app/about/page.tsx` are displayed.

This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to maintain consistent structures across your app.

### Visualization of Layouts

Here’s how layouts work in Next.js:

- The `RootLayout` component contains shared elements such as the header and footer.
- The `children` prop dynamically renders the content of the current page (e.g., from `page.tsx` in the `app` or subfolders).

```plaintext
+-------------------+
| Header            |
+-------------------+
| Page Content      |
| (from children)   |
+-------------------+
| Footer            |
+-------------------+
```

### Step 4: Try It Yourself

As a simple exercise, create your own **header** and **footer** React components and include them in the `RootLayout`. This will help you understand how to structure layouts more effectively in a Next.js application.

## Conclusion

- **Layouts** in Next.js allow you to create shared UI components that are rendered across multiple pages.
- The **root layout** is a mandatory layout that defines the base structure of your app.
- You can easily add elements like headers and footers to the layout and reuse them across the entire application.
