# Selectively Applying Layouts with Route Groups in Next.js

Earlier, we explored **Route Groups** and how they help organize your project without affecting the URL structure. Route groups can also be used to **selectively apply layouts** to specific route segments while leaving others unchanged.

In this post, we'll demonstrate how to use route groups to apply a layout to certain routes without altering the URL.

## Example: Applying Layout to Specific Routes

Letâ€™s take a look at an example where we want to apply a layout to only the `login` and `register` routes but **not** the `forgot-password` route.

### Step 1: Create a Route Group with a Layout

1. **Within the `auth` folder**, create a new folder named `with-layout`.
2. Move the `login` and `register` folders into the `with-layout` folder.
3. Inside `with-layout`, create a `layout.tsx` file and add the following code:

   ```tsx
   export default function AuthLayout({
     children,
   }: {
     children: React.ReactNode;
   }) {
     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Inner Layout</h2>
         {children}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

4. Make `with-layout` a **route group** by renaming the folder to `(with-layout)`:

   ```bash
   app/auth/(with-layout)
   ```

### Step 2: Test the Layout

- When you navigate to `/login`, you will now see:
  - The **"Inner Layout"** heading from the layout.
  - The `login` page content as the `children` prop.
- Similarly, for `/register`, you will see the **layout** applied.

However, when you navigate to `/forgot-password`, the layout is **not** applied. This is because `forgot-password` is **outside** the route group.

### How It Works

- The **route group** `(with-layout)` ensures that only the routes inside the group (`login` and `register`) share the **AuthLayout**.
- The **URL structure** remains unaffected, meaning that the URL for the login page is still `/login` and not `/with-layout/login`.
- Routes **outside** the route group (like `forgot-password`) do not share the layout.

### Why This Is Useful

In large projects, you may have different sections that require unique layouts. Route groups allow you to:

- **Apply specific layouts** to certain sections of your app.
- **Keep URLs clean** by not introducing unnecessary path segments.
- **Organize your code** efficiently by grouping related routes and applying layouts selectively.

## Conclusion

Route groups in Next.js offer a powerful way to selectively apply layouts to specific routes without altering the URL structure. This approach is particularly useful for large projects where certain routes need unique layouts, while others do not.
