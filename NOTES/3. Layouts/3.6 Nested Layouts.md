# Nested Layouts in Next.js

In the previous post, we learned about **layouts**, which are shared UI components that can be applied across multiple pages in a Next.js application. Every Next.js app has a **root layout**, which is the topmost layout and is defined in `layout.tsx` in the `app` folder. In this post, we'll explore **nested layouts**, which allow you to create layouts specific to certain parts of your application.

## What Are Nested Layouts?

**Nested layouts** are layouts that are specific to a section of your application. They are placed inside a route folder and allow you to create specialized layouts for specific routes.

For example, let's say you want to create a layout specifically for a product details page. You can create a layout inside the `products/[productID]` folder, which will apply only to product detail pages.

### Step 1: Creating a Nested Layout

Let’s create a layout for the product details page.

1. **Inside the `products/[productID]` folder**, create a `layout.tsx` file.
2. In this file, define a simple React component that exports a layout:

   ```tsx
   export default function ProductLayout({
     children,
   }: {
     children: React.ReactNode;
   }) {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Featured Products</h1>
         {children}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   - The **`children` prop** here represents the content of the `page.tsx` file inside the `products/[productID]` folder.
   - The layout adds a heading that says "Featured Products". In a real-world scenario, you could use this section to display a carousel of products or related content.

### Step 2: Understanding the Rendering Process

When navigating through the application, the rendering process follows a **nested structure**:

1. **Root Layout**: The root layout (`layout.tsx` in the `app` folder) is rendered first, which includes shared elements like headers and footers.
2. **Nested Layout**: If a specific route, like `/products/[productID]`, has its own layout (`layout.tsx` inside the `products/[productID]` folder), this layout is applied within the root layout.
3. **Page Content**: Finally, the `page.tsx` file inside the `products/[productID]` folder replaces the `children` prop in the nested layout.

### Step 3: Testing Nested Layouts

Let’s see how this works in the browser:

- **Navigating to the root** (`localhost:3000`): The **root layout** will be displayed, showing the header, footer, and any content from `page.tsx` in the `app` folder.
- **Navigating to `/products`**: The root layout remains the same, with the content of `page.tsx` from the `products` folder rendered as the child.
- **Navigating to `/products/1`**: Now, the **nested layout** from `products/[productID]/layout.tsx` will be applied, displaying the "Featured Products" section. The content of `page.tsx` from the `products/[productID]` folder will replace the `children` prop within this layout.

### Key Takeaways

- **Nested layouts** allow you to create layouts specific to certain sections of your app, while still leveraging the root layout.
- The **root layout** is always rendered first, followed by any nested layouts in the route hierarchy.
- This approach gives you flexibility and control over how different parts of your app are structured and presented.

## Conclusion

Next.js supports **nested layouts**, which allow for flexible and customized UI across different parts of your application. By using nested layouts, you can create layouts that apply only to specific routes, enhancing the user experience and maintaining a clean, organized project structure.
