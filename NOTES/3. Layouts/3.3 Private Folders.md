# Private Folders in Next.js

In the previous post, we discussed **safe collocation of files**, a feature supported by Next.js to help organize your project. In this post, we will explore **private folders**, another useful feature in Next.js that helps keep certain files hidden from the routing system.

## What Are Private Folders?

A **private folder** in Next.js is a folder that contains implementation details meant to be hidden from the routing system. When a folder is marked as private, it and its subfolders are excluded from being routable, meaning the files inside won’t generate accessible routes.

To create a private folder, simply prefix the folder name with an underscore (`_`).

### Example: Creating a Private Folder

Let’s look at an example:

1. **Create a private folder** inside the `app` directory. Name it `_lib`:

   ```bash
   app/_lib
   ```

2. Inside `_lib`, create a utility file such as `formatDate.ts` where you might define utility functions. This file will be excluded from the routing system.
3. Now, let’s try to add a `page.tsx` file inside `_lib`:

   ```tsx
   export default function PrivateRoute() {
     return <h1>You cannot view this in the browser.</h1>;
   }
   ```

If you navigate to `localhost:3000/lib`, you’ll encounter a **404 Page Not Found** error. This happens because the `_lib` folder is private, and the `page.tsx` file inside it is **unroutable**.

### When to Use Private Folders

Private folders are useful in several scenarios:

- **Separation of concerns**: Keep UI logic and routing logic separate.
- **Organizing internal files**: Group utilities, helpers, or configurations in one place without cluttering the routing structure.
- **Preventing naming conflicts**: Avoid conflicts with future Next.js file conventions or reserved folder names.
- **Improving code organization**: Group files for better clarity in code editors.

### Including Underscores in URL Segments

If you want to include an underscore in a URL segment, you can use the **URL-encoded** form of an underscore, which is `%5f`. For example, to make the `_lib` folder accessible via the browser, rename it to `%5f_lib`.

```bash
app/%5f_lib
```

Now, you’ll be able to navigate to `localhost:3000/%5f_lib` and see the content of `page.tsx` displayed in the browser.

## Summary

- **Private Folders**: By prefixing a folder name with an underscore (`_`), Next.js will exclude it from the routing system, making its files unroutable.
- **Use Cases**: Private folders help with code organization, separation of UI and routing logic, and avoiding naming conflicts.
- **Underscores in URLs**: Use `%5f` if you want to include an underscore in a URL segment.
