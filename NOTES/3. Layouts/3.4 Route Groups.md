# Route Groups in Next.js

In this post, we will explore **Route Groups**, a feature in Next.js that helps organize project files and routes logically without affecting the URL path structure. This is particularly useful for improving code organization and the developer experience, especially in larger projects or when working in teams.

## Example: Organizing Authentication Routes

Letâ€™s say we are implementing three authentication routes: **Register**, **Login**, and **Forgot Password**.

### Step 1: Creating Basic Authentication Routes

1. Inside the `app` folder, create three folders: `register`, `login`, and `forgot-password`.
2. Inside each folder, create a `page.tsx` file with a simple React component:

   - **Register Route** (`app/register/page.tsx`):

     ```tsx
     export default function Register() {
       return <h1>Register</h1>;
     }
     ```

   - **Login Route** (`app/login/page.tsx`):

     ```tsx
     export default function Login() {
       return <h1>Login</h1>;
     }
     ```

   - **Forgot Password Route** (`app/forgot-password/page.tsx`):

     ```tsx
     export default function ForgotPassword() {
       return <h1>Forgot Password</h1>;
     }
     ```

3. When you navigate to:
   - `localhost:3000/register`, you'll see "Register".
   - `localhost:3000/login`, you'll see "Login".
   - `localhost:3000/forgot-password`, you'll see "Forgot Password".

### Step 2: Organizing Routes with Route Groups

Although the routes work, the authentication-related folders are scattered across the `app` directory, which may become difficult to manage as the project grows. To improve organization, we can group the authentication routes under a single folder.

1. **Create a folder** named `auth` inside the `app` folder and move the `register`, `login`, and `forgot-password` folders into `auth`.

At this point, if you navigate to the browser, the URLs would change to:

- `localhost:3000/auth/register`
- `localhost:3000/auth/login`
- `localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password`

This is because the **auth** folder becomes part of the URL structure.

### Step 3: Using Route Groups to Exclude Folder from URL Path

To exclude the `auth` folder from the URL path, we can make it a **route group** by wrapping the folder name in parentheses:

1. **Rename the `auth` folder** to `(auth)`:

   ```bash
   app/(auth)
   ```

2. Now, when you visit the same routes:

   - `localhost:3000/register`
   - `localhost:3000/login`
   - `localhost:3000/forgot-password`

   The URLs remain the same as before (`/auth` is omitted), but the files are now organized in the `auth` folder, improving project structure.

### Benefits of Route Groups

- **Improved Code Organization**: Route groups help organize files logically without adding extra URL segments.
- **Multiple Levels of Route Groups**: You can nest route groups as needed to create complex folder structures while keeping the URL clean.

## Conclusion

Route groups allow you to organize your project files in a structured way without affecting the URL paths. This improves the developer experience, especially when working on larger projects or in teams.
