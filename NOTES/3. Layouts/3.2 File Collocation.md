# File Collocation in Next.js

Next.js provides flexible routing conventions while allowing you to structure your project files and folders as needed. In this post, we'll explore **file collocation** in Next.js, a practice where you place relevant files close to the routes they correspond to.

## Route Accessibility

Next.js uses a **file-based routing** system where each folder represents a **route segment** in the URL path. However, a route is **not publicly accessible** until you add a `page.tsx` (or `page.js` if using JavaScript) file within the respective folder.

### Example: Creating a Dashboard Route

1. Inside the `app` folder, create a new folder called `dashboard`.
2. Inside the `dashboard` folder, add a file named `lineChart.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   export default function LineChart() {
     return <h1>Line Chart</h1>;
   }
   ```

If you navigate to `localhost:3000/dashboard` at this point, you’ll see a **404 Page Not Found** error. This happens because the **dashboard route** isn’t publicly accessible yet—there is no `page.tsx` file.

### Step 1: Adding the `page.tsx` File

To make the route accessible, create a `page.tsx` file inside the `dashboard` folder:

```tsx
export default function Dashboard() {
  return <h1>Dashboard</h1>;
}
```

Now, if you revisit `localhost:3000/dashboard`, you will see the text "Dashboard". The **key takeaway** here is that the route becomes publicly accessible only when a `page.tsx` file is present.

### Step 2: Collocating Components

Although you can create other files like `lineChart.tsx` inside the `dashboard` folder, they won’t be rendered unless included within the JSX returned from the `page.tsx` file.

For example, to include the `LineChart` component:

```tsx
import LineChart from "./lineChart";

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <LineChart />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This allows you to **collocate components** like `lineChart.tsx` inside the route folder for organizational convenience. However, **collocation is optional**—you can also store components in a separate folder like `components` outside the `app` directory if you prefer.

## Flexibility with File Collocation

Next.js allows you to safely collocate files related to a route segment within the corresponding folder. Alternatively, you can place components in a dedicated folder outside the `app` directory, which is common for larger applications where UI components are reused across different pages.

### Summary

- Routes in Next.js aren't accessible until a `page.tsx` file is added to the respective folder.
- Files can be safely collocated within route segments but aren't mandatory to be there.
- Components, such as `lineChart.tsx`, can be included in the JSX returned by the `page.tsx` file to be rendered on the page.
