# Deep Dive into the `title` Field in Next.js Metadata

In this post, we'll take a closer look at the **`title`** field in the Metadata API, which plays a crucial role in defining the document title for SEO and routing purposes. The title field can be defined either as a **string** or an **object** for greater flexibility.

## Defining the `title` as a String

The simplest way to define the title is by using a string value. This method directly renders the title tag in the browser. For example:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: "About",
};
```

In this case, the title tag in the browser would simply be: **"About - Code Evolution"**.

## Defining the `title` as an Object

For more flexibility, the `title` field can also be defined as an **object**. When using an object, the `title` supports three properties:

1. **default**
2. **template**
3. **absolute**

### 1. `title.default`: Providing a Fallback Title

The `default` property provides a fallback title for child routes that don't explicitly define a title. This is useful for maintaining a consistent title across multiple pages when individual pages don't set their own.

#### Example: Setting a Default Title

In the **root layout** (`layout.tsx`), you can define a default title:

```tsx
import { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    default: "Next.js Tutorial",
  },
};
```

Now, if a child route like `/blog` doesn't specify its own title, it will use the default title: **"Next.js Tutorial"**.

### 2. `title.template`: Creating Dynamic Titles

The `template` property allows you to add a dynamic prefix or suffix to child route titles. The **`%s`** symbol is used as a placeholder that gets replaced by the child page title.

#### Example: Using `title.template`

In the **root layout**:

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    template: "%s | Bug Finderr",
  },
};
```

In the **blog page** (`blog/page.tsx`):

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: "Blog",
};
```

When you visit the blog page (`/blog`), the title will be: **"Blog | Code Evolution"**. The `template` from the layout is applied, where `%s` is replaced by the title of the child page (`Blog`).

### 3. `title.absolute`: Ignoring Parent Templates

If you want a page to have a title that **completely ignores** the `title.template` from parent segments, you can use the `absolute` property.

#### Example: Using `title.absolute`

In the **blog page** (`blog/page.tsx`), set the title as an absolute value:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: {
    absolute: "Blog",
  },
};
```

Now, when you visit the blog page, the title will be simply: **"Blog"**, without the suffix defined in the `title.template` from the layout.

## Summary

- The **`title`** field is essential for SEO and routing, and can be defined as either a string or an object.
- The `title.default` provides a fallback for child routes.
- The `title.template` allows you to create dynamic titles by appending a prefix or suffix to the page title.
- The `title.absolute` ensures the page title completely ignores parent templates.
