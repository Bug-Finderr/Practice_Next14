# Intro to Next.js Routing

Now that we know how to create a new Next.js project and understand its structure, let's dive into one of the key features of Next.js: **file-based routing**.

Next.js uses a file-system-based routing mechanism where the URL paths correspond to files and folders in your codebase. Let's explore this with an example.

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Create a new project** using the command:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest routing-demo
   ```

2. **Start fresh** by deleting the `app` folder inside the `src` folder, as we'll be creating our routes from scratch.

## File-Based Routing in Next.js

In Next.js, routing follows specific conventions:

- All routes must be placed inside the `app` folder.
- Each file that represents a route should be named `page.js` or `page.tsx` (for TypeScript).
- Each folder corresponds to a **URL segment** in the browser.

### Scenario 1: Creating the Homepage Route

1. **Create the `app` folder** inside the `src` folder.
2. Inside the `app` folder, create a file named `page.tsx`.
3. In `page.tsx`, add the following code to render a simple component:

   ```tsx
   export default function Home() {
     return <h1>Welcome Home</h1>;
   }
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000`, and you should see "Welcome Home" displayed on the homepage.

### Scenario 2: Adding More Routes

Let's add two additional routes for the About and Profile pages.

1. **Create the `about` folder** inside the `app` folder.
2. Inside the `about` folder, create a `page.tsx` file:

   ```tsx
   export default function About() {
     return <h1>About Me</h1>;
   }
   ```

3. Similarly, create a `profile` folder inside `app`, and in it, a `page.tsx` file:

   ```tsx
   export default function Profile() {
     return <h1>My Profile</h1>;
   }
   ```

4. Now, if you visit:
   - `http://localhost:3000/about`, you'll see the "About Me" page.
   - `http://localhost:3000/profile`, you'll see the "My Profile" page.

### Understanding Route Conventions

- **Root Route**: `page.tsx` inside the `app` folder maps to the root URL `/`.
- **Nested Routes**: Folders inside the `app` folder create URL segments, so `about/page.tsx` maps to `/about`, and `profile/page.tsx` maps to `/profile`.

### Handling 404 Errors

If a user navigates to a URL that doesn't match any file or folder (e.g., `/dashboard`), Next.js automatically returns a `404 Not Found` response. No additional configuration is required for this.

## Conclusion

Next.js' file-based routing system follows the **convention over configuration** philosophy, simplifying route management. Your file and folder structure directly determines the routes, eliminating the need for manually setting up a router.
