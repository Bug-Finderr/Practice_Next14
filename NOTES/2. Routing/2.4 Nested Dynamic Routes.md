# Nested Dynamic Routes in Next.js

In the previous post, we learned about **dynamic routes** in Next.js. Now, let's explore **nested dynamic routes**, a common requirement when building more complex applications.

## Scenario 5: Nested Product Reviews

Consider the following scenario:

- When a user navigates to `/products/1`, they should see the details of **Product 1**.
- When they navigate to `/products/1/reviews/1`, they should see the **first review** of **Product 1**.

### Step 1: Set Up the Product Route

In the previous post, we already implemented the dynamic route for products, where `/products/[productID]` displays details for a specific product.

Now, we need to extend this to handle reviews for each product.

### Step 2: Create Nested Routes for Reviews

To achieve this, weâ€™ll use a **nested folder structure** to represent the review path.

1. **Inside the `[productID]` folder**, create a new folder named `reviews`. This will map to `/products/[productID]/reviews`.
2. Inside the `reviews` folder, create another folder named `[reviewID]`. This dynamic segment will allow us to access specific reviews, like `/products/1/reviews/1`.

### Step 3: Display Review Details

Inside the `[reviewID]` folder, create a `page.tsx` file with the following content:

```tsx
export default function ReviewDetail({
  params,
}: {
  params: { productID: string; reviewID: string };
}) {
  return (
    <h1>
      Review {params.reviewID} for Product {params.productID}
    </h1>
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Test the Routes

Now, when you navigate to:

- `localhost:3000/products/1/reviews/1`, you will see **Review 1 for Product 1**.
- Similarly, navigating to `localhost:3000/products/100/reviews/5` will show **Review 5 for Product 100**.

### Key Takeaway

By using nested folders and square brackets, we created **nested dynamic routes**. The structure allows us to dynamically access both product and review IDs, enabling flexible routing for complex applications.

### Conclusion

In this post, we successfully implemented **nested dynamic routes** in Next.js. This is a powerful technique for handling scenarios where multiple dynamic segments are needed in the URL.
