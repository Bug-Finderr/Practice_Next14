# Catch-All Segments in Next.js

In the previous posts, we explored **dynamic routes** and **nested dynamic routes** in Next.js. In this post, we’ll look at another powerful routing feature: **Catch-All Segments**. This feature is useful for handling routes with multiple dynamic segments, especially when building complex applications like a documentation site.

## Scenario 6: Documentation Site with Multiple Segments

Imagine you're building a documentation site with several features and multiple concepts under each feature. For example, we need routes like:

- `/docs/feature1/concept1`
- `/docs/feature2/concept2`

With 20 features and 20 concepts per feature, we'd end up with 400 routes! Creating separate files for each route isn't practical. Instead, we can simplify the routing using dynamic routes, but even that could result in deeply nested folder structures.

### Step 1: Using Catch-All Segments

Next.js allows us to handle all these dynamic segments with a **catch-all route**. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. Inside the `app` folder, create a new folder called `docs`.
2. Inside the `docs` folder, create another folder with a special name using three dots (`...`) inside square brackets. This syntax defines a **catch-all route**. Let's name it `[...slug]`:

   ```bash
   app/docs/[...slug]
   ```

3. Inside the `[...slug]` folder, create a `page.tsx` file:

   ```tsx
   export default function Docs({ params }: { params: { slug?: string[] } }) {
     const slug = params.slug || [];

     if (slug.length === 0) {
       return <h1>Docs Home Page</h1>;
     } else if (slug.length === 1) {
       return <h1>Viewing Docs for feature {slug[0]}</h1>;
     } else if (slug.length === 2) {
       return (
         <h1>
           Viewing Docs for feature {slug[0]} and concept {slug[1]}
         </h1>
       );
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 2: Understanding the Catch-All Route

The `catch-all route` will match any URL that includes `/docs`, regardless of how many segments follow it. For example:

- `localhost:3000/docs/feature1` will display "Viewing Docs for feature 1".
- `localhost:3000/docs/feature1/concept1` will display "Viewing Docs for feature 1 and concept 1".
- `localhost:3000/docs` will display the "Docs Home Page".

### Step 3: Optional Catch-All Segments

What if we want `/docs` itself to be caught by the same route? Next.js allows **optional catch-all segments** for this scenario. Simply wrap the square brackets in another set of square brackets to make the segment optional:

```bash
app/docs/[[...slug]]
```

With this setup, navigating to just `/docs` will no longer return a 404. Instead, it will display the "Docs Home Page" by default.

### Step 4: Accessing Route Parameters

In the `page.tsx` file, the `params.slug` object is an array of strings representing the URL segments. We can use this array to customize the content based on the current route, or use it to fetch relevant data (e.g., documentation for a specific feature or concept).

Here’s how we handle the logic:

- If `slug.length === 1`, we display the feature.
- If `slug.length === 2`, we display the feature and concept.
- Anything else, we show the home page.

### Summary

In this post, we learned how to:

- Use **catch-all segments** to handle multiple dynamic route segments in a single file.
- Implement **optional catch-all routes** to match URLs even when segments are missing.
- Access dynamic segments via the `params.slug` array and use it to render content conditionally.

This approach is particularly useful for complex applications like documentation sites, where you may have many dynamic paths but want to maintain a clean folder structure.
