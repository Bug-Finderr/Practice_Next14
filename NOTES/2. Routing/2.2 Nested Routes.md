# Working with Nested Routes

In the previous post, we explored the basics of **file-based routing** in Next.js, learning how the `page.tsx` file inside the `app` folder corresponds to the domain route, and how subfolders create additional routes like `/about` and `/profile`.

In this post, we'll dive into **nested routes**. We'll implement multiple routes under a `/blog` section, including nested routes for specific blog posts.

## Scenario 3: Creating Nested Routes

### Step 1: Create the Blog Route

First, let's create a route for `localhost:3000/blog`:

1. **Create a `blog` folder** inside the `app` folder.
2. Inside the `blog` folder, create a `page.tsx` file:

   ```tsx
   export default function Blog() {
     return <h1>My Blog</h1>;
   }
   ```

3. Start the development server and navigate to `localhost:3000/blog` to see the blog page.

This completes the first part of the scenario. Now, let's implement nested routes.

### Step 2: Adding Nested Routes for Blog Posts

We want to create nested routes for `/blog/first` and `/blog/second`.

1. Inside the `blog` folder, create two new folders: `first` and `second`.
2. In each folder, create a `page.tsx` file to represent the respective routes.

For the `first` route:

   ```tsx
   export default function FirstBlog() {
     return <h1>First Blog Post</h1>;
   }
   ```

For the `second` route:

   ```tsx
   export default function SecondBlog() {
     return <h1>Second Blog Post</h1>;
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Testing the Routes

Once you've saved the files, navigate to the following URLs:

- `localhost:3000/blog/first` will render the **First Blog Post** page.
- `localhost:3000/blog/second` will render the **Second Blog Post** page.

### Key Takeaway

Next.js automatically routes files based on folder structure, making it easy to create nested routes. By simply nesting folders inside the `app` directory, you can achieve nested URLs without any manual configuration.

## Conclusion

In this post, we successfully implemented nested routes in Next.js. This approach simplifies the routing process by leveraging the file and folder structure to define routes.
