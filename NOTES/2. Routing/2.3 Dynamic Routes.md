# Dynamic Routes in Next.js

In the previous post, we learned about **nested routes** by creating a `/blog` folder with subfolders for different blog posts. However, for larger and more complex applications, predefined routes for every case may not be feasible. This is where **dynamic routes** come in handy.

## Scenario 4: Product Listing and Details Page

In this scenario, we need to:

- Display a list of products at `/products`.
- Show specific product details at `/products/[productID]`.

### Step 1: Create the Product List Route

1. Inside the `app` folder, create a `products` folder.
2. Inside the `products` folder, create a `page.tsx` file:

   ```tsx
   export default function ProductList() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Product List</h1>
         <h2>Product 1</h2>
         <h2>Product 2</h2>
         <h2>Product 3</h2>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Visit `localhost:3000/products` to see the product list.

### Step 2: Implementing Dynamic Routes for Product Details

Instead of creating separate folders for each product, we’ll use a **dynamic route**. In Next.js, this is done by enclosing a folder name in square brackets.

1. Inside the `products` folder, create a new folder named `[productID]`.
2. Inside `[productID]`, create a `page.tsx` file:

   ```tsx
   export default function ProductDetails({
     params,
   }: {
     params: { productID: string };
   }) {
     return <h1>Details about Product {params.productID}</h1>;
   }
   ```

3. Now, when you visit:
   - `localhost:3000/products/1`, you’ll see "Details about Product 1".
   - `localhost:3000/products/2`, you’ll see "Details about Product 2", and so on.

### How Dynamic Routes Work

- In Next.js, **square brackets** in folder names create dynamic segments. For example, the `[productID]` folder allows any URL like `/products/[productID]` to be routed dynamically.
- The `params` prop provides access to the dynamic segment. In this case, `params.productID` gives the product ID from the URL.

### Step 3: Handling TypeScript Errors

If you encounter a TypeScript error, ensure that you type the `params` correctly:

```tsx
export default function ProductDetails({
  params,
}: {
  params: { productID: string };
}) {
  return <h1>Details about Product {params.productID}</h1>;
}
```

### Summary

- We created a dynamic route using square brackets in folder names, allowing Next.js to map any product ID dynamically.
- We accessed the product ID using the `params` prop and displayed it on the page.

Dynamic routes are useful when building applications with variable content, like product catalogs, blogs, and user profiles.
